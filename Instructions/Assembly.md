Time to get started! 

first step is to get all of the heat sets placed.  If you are not familiar with this, Nero3D has a couple of good YouTube videos on it.

Start with the lower frame:

Now the upper frame

...and the tool head parts

Next up is attaching the feet to the legs. An M5 nut is captured in the leg and an M5 SHCS attaches the foot.

Attach all fout feet to the lower frame as shown.

Stand it up, insert the 4 8mm rods into place.

This is your firat "square and level check". On a known flat surface, make sure the feet don't wobble. flip it to stand upside down and check for wobbles.  this makes sure all the rods are insterted evenly. 

Grab the lower panel and the inserts. This should be a nice snug fit that can be tapped into place. Assemble all pieces.

Drop down over the rods. Pay atte tion to orientation here.
